   Retruino

   Retruino is a tiny retro gaming console for the arduino,
   it's based on the Arduios, what enables you to upload multiple
   retro games once and play them.

   You can easily write an app by including "kernel.h",
   extending and implementing the methods of the App class
   and registering it in the apps array here.
   (App class is in "kernel.h")

   You can access the Retruino hardware using the "Retruino.h"

   If you need docs just take a look into the '.h' files.

   This is the bootloader of the Arduios, it loads the kernel
   and is the place where your apps should be registered.
